Bitcoinâ€™s mining difficulty is updated every 2,016 blocks (or roughly every two weeks). This is why each 2,016 block interval is called the `difficulty epoch`, as the network determines whether the activities of miners for the last two weeks have reduced or increased the time it takes to mine a new block.

If after two weeks time, we got 2217, which is 10 percent more than usual, then its difficulty will increase 10 percent. 

## what is extra nonce


## stake
crypto is staked or locked on the blockchain to earn. the length of time a crypto must be staked to process transactions can vary as can the min amount of coins or tokens a computer must lock up. the more crypt u stake, more likely you are to process transactions and create a block. proof of stake consensus algorithm has a randomness to determine which computer gets to produce a block containing transactions. 

`Slashing` if the computer tries to break the rules of the blockchain in some way, some of the crypto coins they stake will be destroyed.
